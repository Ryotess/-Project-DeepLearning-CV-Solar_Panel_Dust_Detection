# -Project-DeepLearning-.CV-Solar_Panel_Dust_Detection
This is a Deep Learning/Computer Vision project using SVM, DNN, CNN and common architectures like ResNet, EfficientNet to detect dust on solar penals.

1. Part of the data was downloaded from Kaggle dataset:"Solar Panel Dust Detection", and rest of them was collected from google images by webcrawler program(Python)
2. This project was developed using Python and the following packages: Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and scikit-learn.
3. Feel free to contact me if you want to give me some suggestions or have any question about this project.
